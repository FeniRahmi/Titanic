# Titanic
Titanic Survival Passenger using Random Forest Algorithm

* For this example project I predicted the survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) from the Titanic passenger.
* Using Random Forest classifier.
* Creating new feature (feature engineering).
* The submission score in kaggle is 0.76, which not bad for the first attempt.
